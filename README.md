Expense Ease - ZindaBanda

Our team decided to build a Personal Finance Dashboard.
The Features that we included in our website are:-

●	 Expense Tracker

●	Expense Categorisation 

●	Investment Portfolio Analysis

●	Financial Planning

Our website takes input from the user and makes it easier to track their expenses and plan their financial needs through pictorials and calculations made easy. 

For example,  For investment portfolio analysis we take input from the user on the kind of stock they purchased and in what quantity and price. Our website puts all the investments together in a table so the user can track their investments and calculate their ROI’s 

It takes input from the user to know what kind of expenditure do they have so they can keep track on where they spend more through the pie chart produced by the site.

It teaches the user the 50-30-20 rule through our sites financial planner and tell the user how much money should they spend on their utilities, how high is their allowance and how much money is advisable to invest according to the user’s monthly income. 

We used a combination of Hypertext Markup Language, JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets for our Front-End Development
